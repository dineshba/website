### Backbone of my website:
I am using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build this website. Thanks to [Aswin Karthik](https://aswinkarthik.dev/) for his [blog](https://aswinkarthik.dev/posts/setting-up/) by which I setup this website. Just write markdown files and push, and your website is ready. So cool !!!.

There are lot of themes available [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/). After some search, I landed to current theme which is [hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde). I really liked the theme and it saved lot of my time. This theme gives lot of options to customize our website. I struggled 5 to 10 min to find all hidden options.

### Theme of my website:
Others saved my time

- gohugoio/hugo (571 contributors)
- travisci (94 contributors)
- hyde (spf13 and 27 contributors)
- Aswin Karthik (for his blog)

**What should I do:** Save others time.
As I mentioned, I struggled to find all options in hyde. So I raised a [PR](https://github.com/spf13/hyde/pull/65/files) to update `README` and it got merged :-)

Save **others time by writing blogs** and **contributing to open source**.
