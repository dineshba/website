I would love to quickly share my OSS Journey. I will keep it very short. I am writing this now (on September 2019), because I am gonna celebrate `my first anniversary of my OSS journey` by this October.

| Before one year (October 2018) | Now (September 2019) |
| ----- | ----- |
| No PRs to any tools/libs  | 31 PRS (25 Merged, 3 Open, 3 Closed) [refer](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adineshba+archived%3Afalse+)  |
| Know at hight level what the tool is doing  | Know what internally it is happening (you might get to know which function is getting called :-P)  |
| Okay to live with bugs | Raise issue or fix the bug ([refer](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adineshba+archived%3Afalse+)) |
| Okay to live with existing feature | Trying to think what feature is helpful for me (and for others also) |
| Not attached to any tool/lib | Feeling proud about the tool/lib |
| People from different planet can only contribute | No they are just like me |
| No tools by me | Have atleast one tool ([gg](https://github.com/thecasualcoder/gg)) |
