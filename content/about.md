I'm a **coding freak** who is always interested in solving/seeking challenging problems.

Being in **Thoughtworks**, I found a lot of opportunities to work in various domains, few of them being - devops tools(docker, kubernetes, terraform, etc), mobile(both iOS and Android),  micro services architecture.

In all experiences on my projects, we have used a ton of open source tools and benefited a lot. After taking a lot from community I felt its only natural
to give back as well. So I started doing some open source contributions. 

Few of **my notable contributions**

    sorintlab/stolon
    tonyarnold/Differ
    willowtreeapps/assertk
    thecasualcoder/kube-fzf

I am active on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5305962/dinesh-balasubramanian) also.

I am also a **programming language enthusiast** having worked on GoLang, Elixir, Java, Kotlin, Erlang, Javascript, Typescript, Swift, Objective-C, Bash.
